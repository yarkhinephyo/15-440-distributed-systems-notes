**Confidentiality**: Only Alice can read Bob's messages and Bob can read Alice's.

**Integrity**: Mallory cannot modify messages without the recipient knowing that it had happened.

**Authenticity**: Bob knows he is talking to Alice, Alice knows she is talking to Bob.

**Block Cipher**

- Fixed-length key input and fixed-length key output.
- Cannot encrypt the same block twice with the same key to avoid frequency analysis.

**Stream Cipher**

- Uses an unbounded keystream of random bits, generated by a secret seed.
- Plaintext is XOR-ed with the keystream.
- Cannot use the same key for two messages.

**Counter Mode**

- Use Block Cipher with a counter and a nonce.
- Can reuse the same secret key for multiple messages.

**Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement**

Alice sends (g<sup>a</sup> mod p) to Bob. Bob sends (g<sup>b</sup> mod p) to Alice. They can calculate the common secret. Note that "g" and "p" are agreed first.

<ins>Common secret</ins> = (g<sup>a</sup> mod p)<sup>b</sup> mod p = (g<sup>b</sup> mod p)<sup>a</sup> mod p

**Message Authentication Code (MAC)**

HMAC algorithm is used to produce MAC. HMAC is a symmetric algorithm so a common secret key is required.

**RSA**

Encrypt a message with public key and decrypt it with the private key.

<ins>Digital Signature</ins>: Encrypt a hashed message with the private key. The public key can be used to decrypt and verify the hash.

**Diffie-Hellman with RSA**

Both Alice and Bob publish the public keys in a trusted directory. Alice takes generates (g<sup>a</sup> mod p) with a random number "a", encrypts it with Bob's public key and signs it with Alice's private key. Bob will verify the signature, decrypt it and proceed with calculating the common secret.

**Zooko's Triangle**

A global naming system can have no more than two of the properties below.

1. Human meaningful name.
2. Decentralized.
3. Collision Free.

<ins>Example</ins>

- DNS is collision free and human meaningful.
- Bitcoin is collision free and decentralized.

**Kerberos**

Authentication for a single organization with many computers. Consist of authentication server and ticket granting server.

1. Client sends user ID to authentication server.
2. Authentication server sends encrypted message.
3. Client decrypts it with password to get <ins>ticket-granting ticket</ins>.
4. Client sends TGT to ticket-granting server.
5. Ticket granting server sends back <ins>service tickets</ins>.
6. User requests for services with the service tickets.

**Shiboboleth**

Allows user to access many resources with one identity. Unlike Kerberos which is mainly for LAN, Shibboleth works across the web.

**Authentication**: Alice believes that she is talking to Bob.

**Authorization**: Alice believes that Bob is entitled to direct her to do something.

**Access Control List vs Object Capabilities**

<ins>ACL</ins>: For each resource, a list of users are entitled to use it. More common than capabilities.

<ins>Capabilities</ins>: For each user, there is a list of rights for every object.

|               | ACL System | Capability System |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Add User      | Change     |                   |
| Remove User   | Change     |                   |
| Add Object    |            | Change            |
| Remove Object |            | Change            |

If a system has fewer user centric operations (E.g - add user, remove user) and more object centric operation (ex. add object, remove object) ACL is better.
